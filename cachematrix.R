## The functions makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve work with a matrix object created 
# that can save a cached version of its inverse, created by makeCacheMatrix. 

## To solve the inverse for this matrix object, cacheSolve checks the cache of the matrix 
# and if there have been any changes to the matrix. 
# If the matrix has changed or the inverse has not been calculated before, it computes 
# the inverse of the matrix, and the value is stored in the matrix object. 
# If the inverse has been computed  beforehand and no changes have been made to the matrix
# object, the cached value of the inverse is fetched, eliminating the need to redo a calculation


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse 
# Args: 
# 	x: A matrix vector with no caching

	#Get the value if the matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the matrix in mackeCacheMatrix
# if the inverse has already been calculated, and there have been no changes to the matrix
# chacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache
# Args:
# 	x: a matrix

# Returns: A matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
